# Tweeter üê£

## Tweeter is a simple single page app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and AJAX.
  
  This app leverages the languages stated above to asynchronously retrieve and post Tweets without a single page refresh.

  Utilizing these programs allowed me to create a dynamic Tweeter template which includes,
  - Timestamps on each post.
  - A user profile picture and name.
  - A users profile handle.
  - The Tweet text.
  - And actions on the tweet (re-tweet, like, flag/report).

  This application was built with responsive web design in mind giving the user an optimized experience with any screen.
  
### Attention this app was created for learning purposes only.
